            Written by：Michael Masse/Gerry Goffin<br />
            If I had to live my life without you near me<br />
            The days would all be empty<br />
            The nights would seem so long<br />
            With you I see forever oh so clearly<br />
            I might have been in love before<br />
            But it never felt this strong<br />
            Our dreams are young and we both know<br />
            They'll take us where we want to go<br />
            Hold me now touch me now<br />
            I don't want to live without you<br />
            Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br />
            You ought to know by now how much I love you<br />
            One thing you can be sure of<br />
            I'll never ask for more than your love<br />
            Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br />
            You ought to know by now how much I love you<br />
            The world may change my whole life through but<br />
            Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br />
            If the road ahead is not so easy<br />
            Our love will lead a way for us<br />
            Like a guiding star<br />
            I'll be there for you if you should need me<br />
            You don't have to change a thing<br />
            I love you just the way you are<br />
            So come with me and share the view<br />
            I'll help you see forever too<br />
            Hold me now touch me now<br />
            I don't want to live without you<br />
            Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br />
            You ought to know by now how much I love you<br />
            One thing you can be sure of<br />
            I'll never ask for more than your love<br />
            Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br />
            You ought to know by now how much I love you<br />
            The world may change my whole life through but<br />
            Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br />
            Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br />
            You ought to know by now how much I love you<br />
            The world may change my whole life through but<br />
